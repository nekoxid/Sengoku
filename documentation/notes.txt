positions.txt

	To do positions, take the provinces bmp, flip it vertically in a graphics editor and then the x,y position in the graphics editor will correspond to the in-game one.

		position=
		{
			cityx city unitx unity councilx councily textx texty portx porty
		}

		rotation=
		{
			cityrot unitrot councilrot textrot portrot
		}
	 
	etc

	Worth noting is that text position does not actually matter, the game automatically aligns the text to the province. 
	I also don't think any rotations except port matters, and all provinces appear to have the same height settings.

		The line "nudge_allowed=yes" in "settings.txt" will turn on the in-game map positioning editor (there is a button called "Nudge" in the starting screen.)
		
	Nudge always writes into main map folder!!!
