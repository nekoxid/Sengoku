****************
* Installation *
****************
1) If you have an older version of the mod installed, delete those older versions first.
2) Unzip to My Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod.
3) Make sure the mod was extracted to the correct folder. Inside the 'mod' folder, there should be a sengoku.mod file. If there is not, and instead another 'mod' folder, you extracted the mod incorrectly.
4) Unzip any Hotfixes to your Crusader Kings II folder (same place you installed the mod in step 2).
5) Start the CK2 launcher and check 'Sengoku [Required] Version X.XX' in the list of mods.
6) Check any optional modules you want to use along with Sengoku.
7) Hit play.
